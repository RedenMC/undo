# Reden: Undo only

This is a hard fork of [reden](https://github.com/zly2006/reden-is-what-we-made).
It is **NOT** officially supported by the original author.
This fork is made for ppl who want to use the mod in lower versions to easily backport it.

## Undo & Redo

Ctrl+Z immediately undo the previous operation, making it much more convenient to develop redstone machines!
For more information, please check [our wiki page](https://wiki.redenmc.com/Undo-and-Redo).

## Build

Just run `./gradlew build` in the root directory of the project.
